# Contributing

Since this is a together-work project, there are some guide that you must follow to make sure that our code is always clean and standardized.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before push your commit to this repository.

## Procedure

There are 3 steps for you to contribute to this repository through Github:

1. Always share your plan when creating a branch to another team member to prevent overlapping work.
2. Checkout your branch from `develop` branch. Then name your branch depends on what you will create based on the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

Before submitting a commit or branch:

- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature/hotfix/release doesn't already exist.
- Check another branch from another team member to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the same thing as you do.

## Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests. We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as our main testing framework.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the [README](README.md) and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **One branch per feature/hotfix/release** - If you want to do more than one thing, create another separate branch.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your branch is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
